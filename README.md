By default the resolution is 64x64. This can be changed by clicking change resolution and chosing the dimension. For simplicity you may only enter 1 dimension and the app will make a square canvas for you. Make note that chaning the resolution will reset the canvas and you will lose your work.

The reset Canvas button will clear the work without prompting you about the resolution
